<h2>Another issue after deletion of packages - <init> methods</h2>
</p>When a class contains an <init> method, that method must call another <init> method or the app will crash. <init> methods will generally be calling others in a descending order until a Java type is called. For example "invoke-direct {p0}, Ljava/lang/Object;-><init>()V" If a an <init> from a deleted package was called in a method from a remaining class, the app will crash as the method is missing an <init>. To solve this, simply add an <init> line like the one above in the <init> methods.</p>
